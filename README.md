# order-demand-forecasting
My first independent project using linear regression on a given dataset. This helped me expand my experience with python, basic machine learning, and the relevant python libraries used to perform tasks similar to this,
like Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas.

The data was downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Daily+Demand+Forecasting+Orders. It is described as "a real database of a Brazilian company of large 
logistics. Twelve predictive attributes and a target that is the total of orders for daily."
